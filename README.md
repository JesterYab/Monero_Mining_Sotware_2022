# Monero_Mining_Sotware_2022
Monero just seems to be a beast and periodically does a mega-pump.  I like to have some for those days and it's not a bad one to have in your stash long term as well.  Of course nothing I say is financial advise and you are fully responsible for all your crypto investments.  

Mining Monero is super easy with Minergate and it lets all kinds of people get into mining - even if they only have a laptop or of course all the Mac lover's!  

I made every attempt to have this be a comprehensive beginner's guide to mining Monero.  I cover the essential steps and to get you up and running very quickly, including:

- GPU Hardware Requirements
- OS Requirements â€“ Windows 10 64 bit or Linux (no Mac)
- Proper GPU Drivers
- Getting setup on the Minergate platform
- Performing some tweaks in Windows
- How to 2.5x your Monero mining results!
- How to dual mine your CPU and GPU's

More great crypto content to come. Let me know of any questions / comments / feedback to make this guide better or if you run into any problems along the way.
